MIDDLEWARE and static files

middlware:
a piece of code which runs between the request and response, this code could be anything
example, if you write your css code externally i.e in a different css file, it will not be executed and will throw a 404 error 
in inspect tab as the server is 'requesting' the css file.
Now we can include this css by using MIDDLEWARE by typing the following line after setting the view engine


app.use('/cssFolder', function(req,res,next){
    console.log(req.url);
    next(); //this is just to tell the code to move on to the next middleware or the next piece of code, without this the code will break
}) 

since the css is a static file, express module has an inbuilt middleware 'express.static()'
use this line instead of function

app.use('/cssFolder', express.static('cssFolder'));
