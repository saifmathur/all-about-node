/*
npm init
this command keeps a track of your dependencies, either by package.json
or use the above command in the terminal, in the project directory

this will create a package.json file and that will keep a track


npm install express -save, use this '-save' to save this entry in the package.json file

now, if we give our code to some other developer they wont have to install all
packages manually, they can just use the command
'npm install' and it will search for all dependencies needed for that project
